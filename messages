faq5q = Can I use recalbox in a Bartop or Arcade Cabinet?
faq5r1 = RecalboxOS has been designed to ease the integration of the system into Bartops and Arcade Cabinets. <br/>You can directly connect you controls on the RPi GPIOs, avoiding the addition of an USB controller.<br/>You can deactivate several menu options to avoid unwanted settings. You can also use different video outputs like HDMI/DVI/VGA (with adapters) or RCA.Get more information on <a href\="https\://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/wiki/Configure-recalbox-for-a-Bartop-or-Arcade-Cab-%28EN%29">the bartop page of the wiki</a>.
faq6q = Recalbox contains more than 40 systems, but I only see few of them ?
faq6r1 = Only systems with avaible games are displayed in EmulationStation. Try to add your roms (see the <a href\="https\://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/wiki/Manual-%28EN%29">Manual</a>) and reboot your recalbox to see the new systems.
faq7q = When I start games on some systems, the screen turns black and EmulationStation pops up again after few seconds.
faq7r1 = Some systems require a bios to run the roms. See <a href\="https\://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/wiki/Add-system-bios-%28EN%29">the wiki bios page</a> for more information.

faq10q = Where can I follow the progress of the recalboxOS development ?
faq10r1 = On the <a href\="https\://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os">recalbox-os github</a>, you can refer to "<a href\="https\://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os">issues</a>" wich are the current development tasks.If you refer to recalbox "<a href\="https\://github.com/digitalLumberjack/recalbox-os/milestones">milestones</a>" you will see closed and currently developed tasks for each recalbox version.
faq11q = Do I need to overclock my Raspberry Pi ?
faq11r1 = On Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero, we highly recommend to overclock to EXTREME mode. You will void the warranty of the RPi, but the performance upgrade is really impressive\!

You are too many users updating their recalbox, so servers have too many connextions in same time.<br/>\nWe were not prepared to this. We didn't have this kind of problem with previous releases.<br/>\nSo, we scaled the servers and added mirrors. Once cache filled on these mirrors, the sirtuation should come back to normal.<br/>\nThank you to be patient and for your understanding.<br/>\nPS\: For your information, once your recalbox on standby, the current download still progress. But once done, the screen won't refresh to display the reboot message.<br/>\nSo, sometimes, move your gamepad to wake up your recalbox ;)<br/><br/>\n<p>\nYou can follow the progression of the issue on twitter \: <a href\="https\://twitter.com/recalbox">@recalbox</a></p>\n</div>
